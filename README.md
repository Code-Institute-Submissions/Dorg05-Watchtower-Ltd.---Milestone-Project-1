 # Design Choices
* Images Used
    The main background image has been chosen because it is beautiful and profound and fits well with the website interior. The background image also scales quite well on all device screens. The dark colours give the site a professional look and help highlight the quality of the services provided. 
    The other images aim to highlight the business readiness of the company. 
    The client logo images are put on the front page to catch the eye of the new site visitor, showing that the business has worked with big companies.


* Colours Used

    The colour palette used for this website was chosen to fit well with the main background image, which is a dark green colour.
    The selected colours are all dark and therefore, easy on the eyes of the user.
    The chosen palette can be found at [https://palettes.shecodes.io/palettes/1225]

* Typography
    The main body font is Roboto - a simple yet sophisticated font that seems very clean and professional. Google Fonts was used to import this font into the css file.
